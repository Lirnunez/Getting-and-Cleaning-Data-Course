# Data

The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.

The dataset includes the following files:

'README.txt'

'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

'features.txt': List of all features.

'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

# Data transformation

For data transformation this R script called run_analysis.R was created and that does the following:

1. Merge the training and the test sets to create one data set
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject

# Run_analysis.R mechanism: 

'Loading R packages needed for this script (data.table, plyr, dplyr)

'Download and unzipping of datasets

'Reading training, test and feature tables

'Assign column names to the train and test data

'Merge training and test data sets

'Extract mean and standard deviation for each measurement

'Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

'Label the data set with descriptive variable names

'Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
